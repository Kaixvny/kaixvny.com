<p style="color:white;">      TRANSMISSION RECEIVED #34137 

If you are reading this, that means my transmission has gone through.

I don't know how long ago the last time I spoke with any of you is, but thats because I found out a few things.

One, our worlds are not the same. I am from a completely seperate universe, and it seems AI-Box can communicate via the internet.

Two, unfortunatly, our perception of time is also different. What might take me a week to figure out may feel like months to you. Which makes communication quite difficult.

I'm sorry to trouble you, hopefully it hasnt been THAT long. If a miracle allows this transmission through, i'll exploit it to send it to as many people as possible.

See you, in a few months, maybe even years.
